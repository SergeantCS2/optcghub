"""Update the take stamp in every doc — ONLY the stamp line.

APEX takes 13-25 bumped stamps with a whole-file replace('take N','take N+1').
It happened to be safe because each file carried one take reference, but any
prose deliberately citing an earlier take would have been silently rewritten.
History that edits itself is worse than a stale stamp.
